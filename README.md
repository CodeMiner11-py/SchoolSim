# School Sim
## About
Just a basic school simulator that allows you to create curriculum and saves progress with `pickle`.

## Use
To play the simulator, just run `schoolsimplay.py`.
It saves your games as `.schoolsim` files in a `game_<gamename>` folder (`<gamename>` replaced with your choice of a game name).
